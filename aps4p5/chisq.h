/*
This file defines the class chiquared, which provides the form in which APS
expects to interface with the users' likelihood function.  To write her own 
likelihood function, the user needs to write a class that inherits from the 
chisquared class.

The only method that APS requires the user's likelihood to contain is an operator()
that receives an array_1d<double> of parameters and returns a double that is the
chisquared value at that point in parameter space.

It is very important that the operator that the user supplies increments
called every time it is called.  This is how APS balances its various searches
(by making sure that no one class of search monopolizes all of the calls
to the likelihood function).

Similarly, it is important that the operator contain code like

    double before=double(time(NULL));
    
    execute the chisquared calculation
    
    time_spent+=double(time(NULL)) - before;

This way, APS can also keep track of how much overhead in clock time is
being added to each call to the likelihood function.

The constructor for the user's likelihood function should call the constructor
for the chisquared class with the correct number of dimensions (see the constructors
for the ellipses classes in chisq.cpp for examples)

Most of the other methods defined on the chisquared class exist to support the
various daughter classes also defined in this file, which are cartoon likelihood
meant for testing the performance of APS.

Should the user wish to define a hard boundary on parameter space beyond which the
chisquared value is set to 2.0e30, she can do so using the methods set_min and
set_max in the chisquared class.

Specific methods are documented below.

To see the documentation for the array_1d, array_2d, and asymm_array_2d
classes, consult containers.h

    generating random basis vectors in which to calculate distance
    from the centers of their modes.  This is meant as a way to
    introduce interesting paramter degeneracies.  The boundary
    points found by ths method are reckoned in those bases, not
    in the bases used by APS (though the two may align if the user
    forces them to).
    
    Note also that because each cartoon likelihood is different,
    the actual version of build_boundary to be used must be
    defined by the daughter class of chisquared in question.
