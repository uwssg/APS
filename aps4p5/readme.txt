the documentation is now woefully out of date.  I will begin updating it this
afternoon.

If you need to, be aware that aps_runner_ellipses.cpp gives a complete example
of how to run aps

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  I just merged a massive
rewrite of the software and had to focus on editing the manuscript before a
deadline today.
